This is a light cheat for CS2 that is freely available and modifiable. The cheat is external, so you don’t need to inject it – just compile and run it.

Special thanks to Swed C# for the tutorial on basics of cheats developing, and the Swed64 library. His YouTube channel: SwedishTwat (https://www.youtube.com/@SwedishTwat).

P.S. Do not use this cheat against real players on official servers, as it is unfair.
